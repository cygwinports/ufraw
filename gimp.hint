ldesc: "UFRaw is a utility to read and manipulate raw images from digital
cameras. It can be used by itself or as a GIMP plug-in. It reads raw
images using Dave Coffin's raw conversion utility DCRaw. And it supports
basic color management using Little CMS, allowing the user to apply
color profiles."
